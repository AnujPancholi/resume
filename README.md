# Resume

This will contain my resume(s) that I'm going to try and build with the same skills that I might need for the web.

Why simply advertise one's skills on a resume when one can demonstrate said skill via the resume?

## Note:

I did not make this resume to be deployed as a web page anywhere, just to be run locally and printed once rendered.

Also, the dimensions specified in pixels are supposed to fit an **A4 sheet**, when rendered on a **96 dpi screen**. It's not recommended for any other pixel density. Will try to fix this in the future if possible.
